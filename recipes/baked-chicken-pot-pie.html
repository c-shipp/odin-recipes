                Add onions, carrots, celery, and salt. 
                Cook, stirring, until onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>Season with pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and cayenne, and cook for 1 minute more.
                Add flour and cook until flour toasts to a golden brown on the bottom of the pot, 3 to 4 minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>Stir in 6 cups of broth, and bring to a simmer on high heat, then reduce to medium.
                Add peas and cream and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes.

            </li></p>
